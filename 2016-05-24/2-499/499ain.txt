wheel falls of a canoe, how many ball bearings does it take to fill
up a water buffalo?

HELLO hello Hay him
Ge2:7 And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life;
and man became a living soul.
Ge2:8 And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.
Ge2:9 And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food;
the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
Ge2:10 And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.
